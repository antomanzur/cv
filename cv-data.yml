summary: |
  With 9+ years of experience in the software industry, I’ve worked as a Software Engineer and Tech Lead, collaborating with a wide range of clients—from US-based startups to large corporate teams in Argentina.
  
  Over the past few years, my role has evolved beyond hands-on development into technical leadership and strategic decision-making, contributing directly to the core of the business. I’m actively involved in defining architectures, setting technical standards, mentoring engineers, and aligning technical solutions with product and business goals.

  I’m known for being detail-oriented, highly organized, and a strong communicator, especially in cross-functional and bilingual environments. I value clean architecture, maintainable systems, and thoughtful technical decisions that scale over time.

  I’m deeply committed to my work and strongly believe that a good team can achieve anything!
